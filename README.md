[Journal]-Swift-2026
[Title]

This folder encapsulates all the code used for the model within this publication. Most was written in MatLab, some was written in R. The code is separated by figure and subfigure and should be relatively straightforward organizationally. The code is exported as CSVs which are then imported into GraphPad Prism Files to generate the figures.

While I understand the code, I recognize that it can be a bit cryptic. If for any reason you have any questions please reach out to me at samuel.swift@colorado.edu.

Thanks!
